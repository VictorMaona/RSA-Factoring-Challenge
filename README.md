RSA Factoring Challenge

##RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a public-key cryptosystem, one of the oldest, that is widely used for secure data transmission. The acronym "RSA" comes from the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who publicly described the algorithm in 1977. 

##The most popular public-key cryptography algorithm worldwide is RSA. With only a few known assaults that can be used to break it, it is also one of the most secure. However, this is not an accident; it is by design.
